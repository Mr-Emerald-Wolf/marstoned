				<p class="text-white display-4 pt-2">A Brief History of Space and Us</p>
				<p class="text-white pt-2 gotham">Started in 2054, when Elon Musk terraformed Mars and we all shifted to this planet, MarStoned rolled around, combining old and new recipes, infusing them with new herbs and spices grown both on Mars and Earth. 
					Slowly, we grew bigger and bigger and have now conquered the top position in the food industry. 
					Now we are reimagining the fast food game and bringing new, unthinkable orders to our redesigned menus. Enjoy the Penne Martianna with a hint of Iron Sauce. Treat your kids to a Mark to Veg combined with a Sub Zero Drink and end your family dinner with a brand new Chocolate Supernova made with our own brand new chocolate. 
				So come, enjoy our hard work and leave back for your pod satisfied. And be sure to send a great review back to our friends on Earth too. Enjoy!</p>

					<h4 class=" text-white  text-center display-4 pt-2 ">The Beginning</h4>
					<p class="text-white p-3 m-3 gotham">It all started in 2054, with two guys and a dream. The beauty of food transcends borders, and our founders, Utkarsh Jha and Shivam Sharma wanted to ensure no one would ever miss out on this. They invested all their money and hard work into the restaurant, working day and night, earning little by little, and capitalising on their little idea. With the help of their right decisions and the will to take action, MarStoned has achieved the epitome of success in the food industry and has come to the very top on Earth. Now as humans expand, our story must too. We aim to carry forward the founders’ ideas that they spent their lives working on and hope to prove ourselves again and again as the best in our field</p>

					<h4 class=" text-white  text-center display-4 pt-2 ">Our Aim</h4>
					<p class="text-white p-3 m-3 gotham">Ever since we started, we have focused on creating food that’s not just delicious, but also aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. A picture paints a thousand words, as they say. Preparing food is a master art, and can please anyone’s heart. It has been thanks to you all that we were able to reach this pedestal of masters of the food industry on Earth. But this is not the end of the journey, it’s the very beginning. As human civilisation takes a new step and begins a new chapter, we also turn the page to start a new beginning. 
						Combining our traditional and newly thought of recipes with innovative combinations of herbs and spices, we have infused our foods with an even more mouth watering taste. Dividing the workload between humans and robots, we ensure even more cleanliness and an efficient and faster service. An all new revamped menu with even newer restaurant themes and settings help us reach out more and personalise our services for each generation. Our expert deliverers ensure you do not stay hungry for long.
					We hope you’ll enjoy our new additions so that we can show once again why we are the masters of the food sector. </p>
